+  *Introduction*

   This document will help a user use MSGalaxy Virtual Machine
   using [[file:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][Oracle's VirtualBox Software]]. The user will need to
   import MSGalaxy.ova into the list of their virtual machines.
   It is important to use a computer that has Intel's VT-x or
   AMD-V. This guide will concentrate primary on workflows

+ *Download and Install Oracle's VirtualBox Software*

+ *Download MSGalaxy_VirtualBoxDemo*

  + Due to file size limtations, this virtual machine could not be iploaded to GitHub. Instead, it was publically published in /Google Drive/
  + /Google Drive/ DOES NOT preview well this file, so ignore warnings and download the file

+ *First Steps*

  The virtual machine should already be set up in a way
  that when started, it will log you in to the system.
  Go ahead and click on the Firefox icon on the left side
  of the window. This should automatically send you to:

: http://localhost:8080/MSGalaxy 


  It should look like the next image:

#+CAPTION: Firefox homepage
#+NAME: Welcome Screen
[[file:https://github.com/MSGalaxy/VirtualBoxDemo/raw/master/img/1.png]]
------------
  On the top side of the page, you will see a "User" drop
  down menu. Clicking on it will display a "Login" option that
  you should use

#+CAPTION: The location of the User tab is next to the help tab.
#+NAME: User Tab
[[https://github.com/MSGalaxy/VirtualBoxDemo/raw/master/img/2.png]]
------------
  The system has been setup in such a way that the login information
  is already filled in. Proceed by clicking on "Login"

------------
+ *Uploading a File*

  Uploading a file into MSGalaxy is pretty simple
  From the log in screen on the left tabs there is an icon
  with a upload symbol

#+CAPTION: The location of the upload icon
#+NAME: Upload Icon
[[file:./img/6.png]]
------------
  Clicking on this icon will open a window that allows the user
  to view the files to be uploaded. Since we do not have anything
  in the queue, we should add one by clicking on "Choose local file"

#+CAPTION: Screen with queue file to be uploaded
#+NAME: Queue Screen
[[file:./img/7.png]]
------------
  Navigating to the Documents folder, a file named "machine_data.txt"
  exists for demo purposes. Selecting this file and clicking on "Open"
  will set the file in the queue list

#+CAPTION: Navigate to this location to find the sample file
#+NAME: Test File
[[file:./img/8.png]]
------------
  On the queue screen, there should be now an option "Start" available.
  Clickin on this button will start the upload from the queue list into
  your current history

#+CAPTION: The start button is colored blue
#+NAME: Start Upload
[[file:./img/9.png]]
------------
#+CAPTION: The file in your history
#+NAME: File in History
[[file:./img/10.png]]
------------
+ *Running a Workflow*

  On the top of the page ther is a tab called "Workflow".
  Clicking on this will send you to the page that contains
  all your workflows and shared workflows.

#+CAPTION: Workflow page
#+NAME: Workflow Page
[[file:./img/4.png]]
------------
  You should see two workflows, in this part we will open
  the DSC sample workflow. Clicking on the desired workflow
  should show a drop down menu with several options.

#+CAPTION: Workflow menu
#+NAME: Workflow Menu
[[file:./img/5.png]]
------------
  For this part we will select the "Run" option and it should send
  the user back to the history. In the history you will now be greeted
  with a description of the workflow. In this window you can choose your
  file(s) to run the workflow. You will also be able to change the options
  of any steps in the workflow.

#+CAPTION: Workflow minor editing page
#+NAME: Workflow minor edit
[[file:./img/11.png]]
------------
  Clicking on "Run Workflow" will submit the job into the computer and
  your history will update accordingly. Note how your history has new datasets
  and they will go from clear to yellow. The absence of color indicates
  that a job is not yet submmited, yellow indicates that the job is running,
  green that the job is completed successfully, and red indicates there were
  errors. You are able to see the output of the dataset by clicking on the
  "View data" icon in the dataset represented with an eye. This will
  display the contents of the dataset on the main page.

+ *Create a New History*

  In order to reduce clutter of datasets it may be a good idea to
  create a new history. On the top right area of the page there is
  an icon of a gear called "History options". A drop down menu will
  appeared when clicked on, and you should click on "Create New" to
  make a new history. Note that any previous histories are saved by
  MSGalaxy and can be viewed by selecting the "Saved Histories" option.
  After creating a new history you can rename it by double clicking on
  "Unnamed history" and changing it to any name

------------
+ *Editing a workflow*

  If we return on the Workflow page by clicking on the tab
  on top of the page, we can then select the "Edit" option
  on the "MaterialProject Sample" workflow

#+CAPTION: Click on Edit
#+NAME: Edit Menu
[[file:./img/20.png]]
------------
  This will bring you to a workflow workspace where you can edit your
  workflow. This is done by selecting a tool on the left which will add
  a new box in the workspace. Then you are able to connect the workflows
  by clicking the arrows on the right of the box(outputs) to the right
  of another box. Clicking on a box will allow you to change any settings
  for that particular tool

#+CAPTION: The workspace to edit workflows. Available tools are on the left and the boxes have inputs and outputs that can be connected to other tools
#+NAME: Workspace
[[file:./img/21.png]]
------------
#+CAPTION: Individual tool options
#+NAME: Tool options
[[file:./img/22.png]]
------------
  Clicking on the gear on the top right corner, you will be able
  to save, run, edit attributes, auto re-layout, and close
  the workspace. Go ahead and save the workflow and then run the workflow
  by clicking the appropiate options. This will bring you to a familiar
  page that describes the tools in your workflow. In this case we will
  input the trinary system "Co,V,Al" for the tool to work on.  The jobs
  will be submitted as soon as the job in a previous step of the
  workflow is completed. When the job is done you should be able to
  explore the outputs

#+CAPTION: Save, the run the workflow

+ *Notes*

  Do note that this short guide is not meant to be a
  comprehensive guide to MSGalaxy. Also, some tools in MSGalaxy
  may not be fully functional since this Virtual Machine is meant
  for basic demo purposes
